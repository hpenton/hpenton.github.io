### Costs and Licences

- Believe the space is free - payment is for machines that model building is done on

### Example Repositories

- Example repo

### Knowledgeable Worth People

- Henry

### Learning Resources

- <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-azure-ml-in-a-day">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-azure-ml-in-a-day</a>

### Maturity

- Seems quite mature - Second iteration, replaces machine learning studio (classic)

### Overview

- Pipelines
- Notebooks
- Ways to build models

### Project Examples

- ml-insurance-research

### Strengthes

- Quick
- Appears to be relatively cheap to play around with for a day
- Scalable clusters

### Weaknesses

- Layout is a little unclear
- Feels like maybe there are many ways to achieve the same thing
